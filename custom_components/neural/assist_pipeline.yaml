# Neural AI Assist Pipeline Configuration
# This file should be placed in the Home Assistant configuration directory
# and referenced in the Assist pipeline configuration

# Example configuration for Assist pipeline
# Add this to your configuration.yaml:

assist_pipeline:
  - name: "Neural AI"
    language: "es"
    conversation_engine: "conversation"
    conversation_language: "es"
    stt_engine: "neural"
    stt_language: "es"
    tts_engine: "cloud"
    tts_language: "es"
    tts_voice: "es-ES-Standard-A"
    wake_word_engine: "openwakeword"
    wake_word_id: "neural"

# Alternative configuration for local TTS only:
# assist_pipeline:
#   - name: "Neural AI Local TTS"
#     language: "es"
#     conversation_engine: "conversation"
#     conversation_language: "es"
#     stt_engine: "neural"  # Still uses Neural STT with OpenRouter
#     stt_language: "es"
#     tts_engine: "piper"    # Local TTS
#     tts_language: "es"
#     tts_voice: "es-carlfm-x-low"
#     wake_word_engine: "openwakeword"
#     wake_word_id: "neural"

# Configuration steps:
# 1. Install required integrations:
#    - Whisper (for local STT)
#    - Piper (for local TTS)
#    - OpenWakeWord (for wake word detection)
#
# 2. Configure the pipeline in Home Assistant UI:
#    - Go to Settings > Assistants
#    - Create a new assistant named "Hal"
#    - Configure with the settings above
#
# 3. The Neural AI integration will automatically register as an intent handler
#    and will process commands through the Assist pipeline.
