# Neural AI Assist Pipeline Configuration
# This file should be placed in the Home Assistant configuration directory
# and referenced in the Assist pipeline configuration

# Example configuration for Assist pipeline
# Add this to your configuration.yaml:

# assist_pipeline:
#   - name: "Neural AI"
#     language: "es"
#     conversation_engine: "conversation"
#     conversation_language: "es"
#     stt_engine: "cloud"
#     stt_language: "es"
#     tts_engine: "cloud"
#     tts_language: "es"
#     tts_voice: "es-ES-Standard-A"
#     wake_word_engine: "openwakeword"
#     wake_word_id: "neural_ai"

# Or use the UI to configure the pipeline with these settings:
# - Language: Spanish (es)
# - STT Engine: Cloud (or local if available)
# - TTS Engine: Cloud (or local if available)
# - Wake Word: openWakeWord (if installed)
# - Conversation Engine: conversation (default)

# The Neural AI integration will automatically register as an intent handler
# and will process commands through the Assist pipeline.
